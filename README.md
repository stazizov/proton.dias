HI! 

I'm Said Azizov, a 20-year-old AI founder with a strong track record in generative AI innovation and language preservation. After winning the AI Journey International competition (1st place) and becoming a prize winner at the National Technological Olympiad, I was invited to Sber AI Research, where I contributed to the development of Kandinsky 3.0, a leading text-to-image model.

As a co-founder of XLabsAI, our team was the first to develop the IP Adapter, as well as pioneering a series of ControlNets and LoRA models, reaching tens of thousands of downloads and significantly impacting the generative AI space. Additionally, demonstrating leadership and commitment to cultural preservation, I led the creation of the first-ever AI translator for the Lezghian language and released its largest open-access linguistic corpus.

Currently, I'm building **NeuroApps**, an innovative marketplace of AI agents with a unified input interface, where a central AI assistant communicates with users and dynamically interacts with specialized agents from the marketplace as needed. NeuroApps is designed as a mutually beneficial platform, empowering developers to monetize their AI skills and enabling users to access advanced, tailored AI solutions seamlessly.
